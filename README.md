## CS3004 - Securing Information Systems
### Final Project
#### DES Cryptosystem Implementation

1. Usage: 
    + // TODO: ...
2. Syntax for the 'config' file:
    + `operation=encrypt|decrypt|verify`
    + `mode=CBC|ECB`
    + `format=ASCII|BASE64`
3. Provided examples:
Our project includes a folder called "Examples" which includes three different sample files which can be used in order to test the capababilities of our implementation. In Each example there is a sample of the cyphered data (as a BASE64 encoded file - as requested), and a sample file which contains the expected data after decrypting the encrypted file.
